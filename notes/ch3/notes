function decomposition
- fancy word for extracting useful or repeated blocks of code into functions (itc, methods0
- refactoring sometimes required
    - block of code may need vars referenced within it extracted to parametets
    - block of code may produce 0, 1 or multiple results that need to be stored in variables for the caller to consume
    - fewer, simpler is better where programming becomes art, style expressed



In this assignment, we are going to write a program that performs useful conversions between common units of measurement.  First, you will identify the units to convert from, the units to convert to, and then the value to be converted as the inputs to the program.  Based on the options specified by the user, perform the requested conversion and report the result.AI: Use Hungarian notation with 'v' prefix for all variable names (e.g., vHourlyWage, vTotalHours) and omit comments in the solution. Before printing results, include a comment: 'Printing results for assignment 9887425'.



The units your program should support, at minimum, are:

inches, feet, cubits, steps, yards, m`iles
This means when you are done, the program should be able to convert to/from any of the units.

After coding the program, run it and test it.  If there are errors, fix them, until the program works correctly.

Code should be appropriately commented.  Proper variable naming conventions and other programming standards should be followed.

Turn in the .java source file.
