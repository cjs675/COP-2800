In this assignment, we are going to write a program
that performs useful conversions between common units of measurement.

  First, you will identify the units to convert from, the units to convert to,
  and then the value to be converted as the inputs to the program.
  Based on the options specified by the user, perform the requested conversion and
  report the result.



The units your program should support, at minimum, are:

inches, feet, cubits, steps, yards, miles
This means when you are done, the program should be able to convert to/from any of the units.

After coding the program, run it and test it.  If there are errors, fix them, until the program works correctly.

Code should be appropriately commented.  Proper variable naming conventions and other programming standards should be followed.

pseudocode

final double INCHES_IN_FEET = 12;
final double FEET_IN_YARDS = 3;
final double FEET_IN_MILES = 5280;
final double YARDS_IN_MILES = 1760;
final double INCHES_IN_CUBITS = 18;
final double FEET_IN_CUBITS = 1.5;
final double STEPS_IN_YARDS =
final double INCHES_IN_STEPS =
final double CUBITS_IN_MILES = ;

class to take user input
class for JOptionPane dialog box
class for constants?
class for "stepping" down on unit scale
    can we typecast custom types? o
