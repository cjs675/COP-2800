** common conventions used in java **

- java is __case sensitive__ 
    - class named __System__ is different from __system, SYSTEM, sYsTeM__ 
- begin class names with __UppercaseLetters__  
 ```java 
public class CoffeeTable
```  
- __all__ java statements end with ;
```java
System.out.println("Error: input not a string");
```

- String literals __must__ be placed on the same line 
- any literal string is written between " double quotes "  
- method names __always__ followed by parentheses --> __println()__  


- begin new words within classes with uppercase letters 
- underscores uncommonly used to indicate new words 
    - ie. __Inventory_Item__ 
- using all uppercase for class identifiers is not conventional 
- class names do not begin with a __lowercase__ letter
