## notes on intelliJ 

- /out dir is intelliJ's "build folder" (ide specific)
  - temporary
  - contains compiled bytecode & build artifacts 
  - keeps project organized & clean 
  - when running programs, JVM executes __.class__ files from __/out__ instead of source __.java__ files 
  - intelliJ only recompiles changed files, storing results in __/out__ for faster builds
